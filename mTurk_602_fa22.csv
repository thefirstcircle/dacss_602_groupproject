It has impact on human health, livestock, livelihood assets, food production and distribution channels that ensures that the food is placed on consumers’ table [sic] on time. Because it affects consumer purchasing power and market flow, it changes consumers’ food consumption pattern. Many family members are experimenting with new foods and many other consumers are willing to consume new food items not familiar to them. The climate change also influences food safety and quality that go with it all (Schmidhuber and Tubiello, 2007).""","<img src=""https://umassamherst.co1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_5gOqTwseGUhLgR8"">","<img src=""https://umassamherst.co1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_0p7NxWEoIZ5mLXM"">",,1,,1,,,,,,1,,1,,,1,,,,,,,1,1,,,,1,,2,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,,1
